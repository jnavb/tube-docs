Functions are the element for how pipes are composed

# Simple usage

To use a function inside a pipe you only need to type its name. Each function is declared in 
a single line, there cannot be more than one function per line.

### Example

<TubeCode>{`foo\n`}</TubeCode>
<JSCode>{`const foo = () => 1
`}</JSCode>

> 1
